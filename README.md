# What makes a WEBTOON Original successful?

Society has been entertained by visual storytelling since the cave ages and humans, as the simple creatures that we are, continue to be fascinated with it today.

The following data is sourced from a **Kaggle community-provided dataset** scraped from **774 WEBTOON series** that are **company-sponsored** and thus reach more viewers on the platform, called **WEBTOON Originals**.

Though cut-and-dry figures are not the sole indicator of a "good" WEBTOON, figures like the number of subscribers and series ratings can identify patterns in Originals that statistically perform well among readers.

These figures in the dataset are graphed to show that, although ratings are similarly high across Originals of all genres, when combined with subscriber count analysis, ***Romance, Fantasy, and Action Originals prove to be the most popular.***
