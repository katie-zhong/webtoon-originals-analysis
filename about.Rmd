## About the Project
[WEBTOON](https://www.webtoons.com/en/) is a platform that has made the age-old art of visual storytelling accessible to anyone with an internet connection anywhere, whether they're a reader or an author.

This project attempts to answer the question *What Makes a WEBTOON Original Successful?* and provides insight on what makes WEBTOON Originals (WEBTOON-sponsored series) popular among readers.

**This project was created as part of the amazing [David Kane's Data Science Course](https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/), offered by [former Harvard Preceptor David Kane](https://www.davidkane.info/).**

**The warmest of thank yous to the wonderful Preceptor Kane, our superhero TFs, and the supportive classmates that made this experience so enjoyable and rewarding! :)**


## About The Creator
Hey! It's me, that little voice writing out all these words, finally introducing myself. My name is **Katie Zhong** and I'm an incoming Honours Mathematics freshman at the University of Waterloo.

I love music, reading, stories, and art (as you may have guessed üòÖ).

Feel free to reach out with any **music/book/WEBTOON recommendations**, **questions/suggestions** for this project, or **opportunities to further explore data science**!
