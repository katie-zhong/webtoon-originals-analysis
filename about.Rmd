## About the Project
[WEBTOON](https://www.webtoons.com/en/) is a platform that has made the age-old art of visual storytelling accessible to anyone with an internet connection anywhere, whether they're a reader or an author.

*What Makes a WEBTOON Original Successful?* provides insight on what makes WEBTOON Originals (WEBTOON-sponsored series) popular among readers.

This project was created as part of the amazing [David Kane's Data Science Course](https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/). Thank you to Preceptor Kane and the wonderful TFs that made this experience so enjoyable and rewarding! :)


## About The Creator
Hey! It's me, that little voice writing out all these words. My name is **Katie Zhong** and I'm an incoming Honours Mathematics (co-op) freshman at the University of Waterloo.

I love music, reading, stories, and art (as you may have guessed ðŸ˜…). Got any recommendations? [Feel free to share](https://www.linkedin.com/in/katie-zhong-163684163/), I'll give anything a try!
