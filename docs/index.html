<p><p>What Makes a WEBTOON Original Successful?</p></p>
</div>


<div class="d-article">
<h1 id="introduction"><strong>0. Introduction</strong></h1>
<p>Visual storytelling has been around for ages—ever since humans
smeared berry juice on cave walls with sticks.</p>
<p>In the modern age, WEBTOON provides a platform for anyone anywhere to
upload their own visual stories for readers around the world to read for
free.</p>
<p>WEBTOON is a veritable treasure trove of stories, perfect for a bad
day pick-me-up or to inspire you to take charge as the main character of
your own story. And though each is valuable in its own way, some stories
still do better than others. Why?</p>
<h3 id="metrics-of-success"><strong>Metrics of Success</strong></h3>
<p>Cut-and-dry figures are not necessarily the sole indicator of a
“good” WEBTOON, but data analysis can identify patterns in Originals
that statistically perform well among readers.</p>
<p>The most blatant common denominator that may reveal patterns is a
series’ genre. Do certain genres perform better than others? Which
genres are more popular among readers?</p>
<p>To measure how genre and overall success of a series are related, we
compare the independent variable of genre with the dependent variables
of the <strong>number of subscribers (in millions)</strong> and
<strong>average series rating (rated from 0-10 by readers)</strong>
within a <a
href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iridazzle/webtoon-originals-datasets">sample
set of 774 WEBTOON Originals</a>.</p>
<h3 id="top-webtoon-originals"><strong>Top WEBTOON
Originals</strong></h3>
<p>Originals are WEBTOON-sponsored stories. Original series are provided
compensation, editors, and marketing support, among other benefits.</p>
<p>WEBTOON compiles their own list of “Top” (most popular) Originals,
which almost certainly considers many more factors than the two analyzed
in this project.</p>
<p>The following data is pulled from <a
href="https://www.webtoons.com/en/top">WEBTOON’s list of most popular
Originals across all 16 genres</a>, as of June 30th, 2022, are:</p>
<h2 id="figure-1">Figure 1</h2>
<div class="layout-chunk" data-layout="l-body">
<p><img src="pop_all_genres.png" width="440" /></p>
</div>
<h5 id="top-originals-from-all-genres.-webtoon-2022"><em>Top Originals
from all genres. (WEBTOON, 2022)</em></h5>
<p>Note that half of these series are tagged under the Romance genre,
with two of the series not directly tagged as Romance still containing
central romance themes (<em>The Unmarried Empress</em> and <em>Suitor
Armor</em>).</p>
<p>This trend, that Romance Originals are among the most successful
Originals, will later be corroborated through analysis.</p>
<p>To conclude this project, we generate a list of 10 Originals that
perform well among both metrics of subscribers and series ratings. We
then compare this list to WEBTOON’s official rankings.</p>
<h3 id="webtoon-genres">WEBTOON Genres</h3>
<p>Figure 1 displays which genres contain more Originals.</p>
<h2 id="figure-1-1">Figure 1</h2>
<div class="layout-chunk" data-layout="l-body">
<p><img src="index_files/figure-html5/percent_originals_per_genre_plot-1.png" width="624" /></p>
</div>
<h5 id="kaggle-2022"><em>(Kaggle, 2022)</em></h5>
<p>Note that some genres contain notably more Originals than others
(Fantasy and Romance) and that the genre distribution does not
completely parallel the distribution of average ratings (Figure 2) nor
subscribers (Figure 3) across genres.</p>
<p>From this observation, we can conclude that genre does indeed have
some effect on a series’ success.</p>
<h1 id="genres-and-success">1. Genres and Success</h1>
<p>We can further measure a series’ success with series ratings.</p>
<p>Series ratings are optional and entirely reader-contributed. Some
factors readers may consider when voting on series ratings are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Art quality</li>
<li>Writing quality (i.e. plot, characters)</li>
<li>Reader’s enjoyment</li>
</ul>
<p>These factors are shown at play in Figure 2, below.</p>
<h2 id="figure-2">Figure 2</h2>
<div class="layout-chunk" data-layout="l-body">
<p><img src="index_files/figure-html5/genre_ratings_plot-1.png" width="624" /></p>
</div>
<p>Note that the y-axis scale of the graph starts at 8.8 to emphasize
the rating differences. The standard deviation (δ) is relatively low, so
most of the series ratings are quite close to the mean rating (μ) for
all genres. Adding a jump to the scale makes it easier to see the minute
difference in ratings.</p>
<p>Continuing the analysis, success can also be measured by the number
of subscribers (Figure 3).</p>
<h2 id="figure-3">Figure 3</h2>
<div class="layout-chunk" data-layout="l-body">
<p><img src="index_files/figure-html5/genre_subscribers_plot-1.png" width="624" /></p>
</div>
<p>Romance wins by a landslide! How very romantic of you, WEBTOON
readers. Fantasy comes second for number of subscribers, with Action and
Drama at a close third and fourth.</p>
<p>Heartwarming ranks last in subscriber-based popularity. Despite
receiving the highest ratings, this conclusion is reasonable, seeing as
there are only 2 Originals in the Heartwarming genre. (WEBTOON authors,
do you see this unfulfilled market niche? 👀)</p>
<h1 id="subscribers-vs.-ratings">2. Subscribers vs. Ratings</h1>
<p>To determine if subscribers (largely representing popularity) and
ratings (largely representing quality) are related, we compare
subscribers and ratings.</p>

That's what they told me. \"The DaneMen\" is a silent comic strip. People<br />                  all look the same. There are three main flavors: absurd, truthy and<br />                  grim. Hitchcock said \"Drama is life with all the dull bits cut out.\" Too<br />                  bad. Life is 99% dull bits. Seems like a waste of bits to me. Chaplin<br />                  said \"Life is a tragedy when seen in close-up, but a comedy in long-<br />                  shot.” Well...\"The DaneMen\" has close-ups, long-shots, AND mediums-<br />                  shots! Take that, Chaplin!\" <br />","Title: FAMILY MAN <br /> Author(s): Pillwon Jung <br /> Rating: 9.72 <br /> Subscribers (mil): 0.04 <br /><br /> Genre: DRAMA <br /> Status: COMPLETED <br /> Synopsis: Gang-ho is a laborer at the local factory, sleeping just 3 hours a day and working like<br />                  a horse.
