<h2 id="metrics-of-success"><strong>Metrics of Success</strong></h2>
<p>Though cut-and-dry figures are not necessarily an indicator of a
“good” WEBTOON, data analysis can identify patterns in Originals that
statistically perform well among readers.</p>
<p>The follow metrics of success are compared to variables such as genre
throughout this project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of subscribers</li>
<li>Rating</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="genres-and-popularity">Genres and Popularity</h2>
<div class="layout-chunk" data-layout="l-body">
<p><img src="genre_ratings.png" width="1050" /></p>
</div>
<p>Note that the y-axis scale starts at 8.5 to emphasize the rating
differences. Average series ratings are about the same for Originals
across all genres, with Originals from the Heartwarming genre receiving
the highest and Originals from the Superhero genre receiving the
lowest.</p>
<div class="layout-chunk" data-layout="l-body">
<p><img src="genre_subscribers.png" width="1331" /></p>
</div>
<p>Romance wins by a landslide! How very romantic of you, WEBTOON
readers. Fantasy comes second for number of subscribers, with Action and
Drama at a close third and fourth.</p>
<p>Heartwarming ranking last in subscriber-based popularity, despite
receiving the highest ratings, makes sense as there are only 2 Originals
in the Heartwarming genre. (WEBTOON authors, do you see this unfulfilled
market niche? 👀)</p>
