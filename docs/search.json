Thank you to our ‚Äúdear leader‚Äù Preceptor Kane, our superhero\r\nTFs, and the supportive classmates that made this experience so\r\nenjoyable and rewarding! :)\r\nAbout The Creator\r\nHey!

My name is Katie Zhong and I‚Äôm an\r\nincoming Honours Mathematics freshman at the University of Waterloo.\r\nI love music, reading, stories, and art (as you may have guessed üòÖ).\r\nGot any recommendations?

      "contents": "\r\nMetrics of Success\r\nThough cut-and-dry figures are not necessarily an indicator of a\r\n‚Äúgood‚Äù WEBTOON, data analysis can identify patterns in Originals that\r\nstatistically perform well among readers.\r\nThe follow metrics of success are compared to variables such as genre\r\nthroughout this project:\r\nNumber of subscribers\r\nRating\r\nGenres and Popularity\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that the y-axis scale starts at 8.5 to emphasize the rating\r\ndifferences. Average series ratings are about the same for Originals\r\nacross all genres, with Originals from the Heartwarming genre receiving\r\nthe highest and Originals from the Superhero genre receiving the\r\nlowest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRomance wins by a landslide! How very romantic of you, WEBTOON\r\nreaders. Fantasy comes second for number of subscribers, with Action and\r\nDrama at a close third and fourth.\r\nHeartwarming ranking last in subscriber-based popularity, despite\r\nreceiving the highest ratings, makes sense as there are only 2 Originals\r\nin the Heartwarming genre. (WEBTOON authors, do you see this unfulfilled\r\nmarket niche? üëÄ)\r\nSubscribers vs.¬†Ratings\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nViewer ratings and subscriber counts prove that Romance and Fantasy\r\nOriginals are the most popular.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\nIt‚Äôd be criminal of me to create a WEBTOON-themed project and not\r\nprovide recommendations, eh? Take a gander at some of my favorites\r\nbelow, in alphabetic order!\r\nYou can find the synopses online, so I‚Äôll just be providing my two\r\ncents. üòâ\r\nOriginal Recommendations\r\nBig Jo, Jungle Julia\r\nA lovely, light but also poignant read that explores body confidence\r\nand all the chaos of being a teenager exploring romantic connection and\r\nthe world.\r\nThe series is finished and not on Daily Pass, which further cements\r\nits binge-worthy status!\r\n\r\nEleceed, Jeho Son and ZHENA\r\nA light read with humorous moments, mindboggling action scenes, and\r\nadorable relationships (between friends, mentor-peers, and some hints of\r\nromantic ones). Electric (haha, that‚Äôs an Eleceed reference) atmospheric\r\nart to pair!\r\n(Also: the author draws cats in the absolute best way!)\r\n\r\nMoon You, Cho Seok\r\nAbsolutely hilarious read with fantastic art too. It is a Daily Pass\r\nseries now, which means you can only read one episode per day for free.\r\nMoon You is a great read though, and Daily Pass does monetarily\r\nsupport the author!\r\n\r\nMuted, Miranda Mundt\r\nParallel City, Goda\r\nA very well done zombie apocalypse story with both intriguing\r\nplotlines revolving the apocalypse and its characters. Overall extremely\r\nhigh-quality.\r\nBut‚Ä¶ maybe don‚Äôt read this one at night. üò∞\r\n\r\nPurple Hyacinth, Ephemerys and\r\nSophism\r\nEven if murder mystery with unbearable romantic tension isn‚Äôt\r\nexactly your cup of tea, PH‚Äôs undeniable quality may just win you over.\r\nThe delightfully written characters and ingenious plot combined with the\r\ncinematic and deliberately meme-packed art make this one a veritable\r\nWEBTOON Original classic!\r\n\r\nRoom of Swords, Toonimated\r\nOne of my favorite WEBTOONs of all time!\r\nAnd that‚Äôs despite being genuinely confusing to me haha; the plot is\r\nabsolutely wild. Time travel, sci-fi, romance, psychological\r\nmanipulation, colorful action scenes, the unexpected‚Ä¶ Room of Swords has\r\nit all!\r\n\r\nSee You in My 19th Life, Lee\r\nHey,\r\nThe Croaking, echorise\r\nThe first WEBTOON I ever read!\r\n\r\nThe Red King, Heylenne\r\nYour Smile is a Trap, AENGO\r\nCanvas Recommendations\r\nBOMIC: A Bom Comic, c2oh\r\nBUUZA!, Shazleen Khan\r\nCarciphona, Shilin\r\nOne of my favorite authors/artists of all time; Shilin‚Äôs art style\r\nand well-developed characters are incredibly beautiful and\r\nendearing.\r\nI‚Äôll also recommend Shilin‚Äôs Amongst Us (no, it‚Äôs not\r\nrelated to the game Among Us), the modern spin-off of Carciphona!\r\n\r\nImmortal Affairs, Blue.Owl\r\nA really interesting take on immortal beings, with characters that\r\nfeel like real people and incredible character-driven storylines.\r\nSome really great life lessons packed into the chapters too!\r\n\r\nRevelation of Eros, AkumaYoru\r\nA very heartbreaking story, based on the true story of the author in\r\nthe author-artist duo behind this WEBTOON.\r\nThere‚Äôs comedy, friendship, and romance served alongside the\r\ncharacters‚Äô growth. Always hits me right in the feels.\r\n\r\nThis Isekai Maid is Forming a Union!, Frostlight\r\nComics\r\nThe nuanced looks at problematic media and multidimensional\r\ncharacters blow my mind each chapter!\r\nThe story is woven in a way that leads readers to decide for\r\nthemselves what is wrong or right, and features satisfyingly competent\r\ncharacters, both in the protagonist and villain rosters.\r\n\r\n",
