      "contents": "\r\n0. Introduction\r\nVisual storytelling has been around for ages‚Äîever since humans\r\nsmeared berry juice on cave walls with sticks.\r\nIn the modern age, WEBTOON provides a platform for anyone anywhere to\r\nupload their own visual stories for readers around the world to read for\r\nfree.\r\nWEBTOON is a veritable treasure trove of stories, perfect for a bad\r\nday pick-me-up or to inspire you to take charge as the main character of\r\nyour own story. And though each is valuable in its own way, some stories\r\nstill do better than others. Why?\r\nMetrics of Success\r\nCut-and-dry figures are not necessarily the sole indicator of a\r\n‚Äúgood‚Äù WEBTOON, but data analysis can identify patterns in Originals\r\nthat statistically perform well among readers.\r\nThe most blatant common denominator that may reveal patterns is a\r\nseries‚Äô genre. Do certain genres perform better than others? Which\r\ngenres are more popular among readers?\r\nTo measure how genre and overall success of a series are related, we\r\ncompare the independent variable of genre with the dependent variables\r\nof the number of subscribers (in millions) and\r\naverage series rating (rated from 0-10 by readers)\r\nwithin a sample\r\nset of 774 WEBTOON Originals.\r\nTop WEBTOON\r\nOriginals\r\nOriginals are WEBTOON-sponsored stories. Original series are provided\r\ncompensation, editors, and marketing support, among other benefits.\r\nWEBTOON compiles their own list of ‚ÄúTop‚Äù (most popular) Originals,\r\nwhich almost certainly considers many more factors than the two analyzed\r\nin this project.\r\nThe following data is pulled from WEBTOON‚Äôs list of most popular\r\nOriginals across all 16 genres, as of June 30th, 2022, are:\r\nFigure 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTop Originals\r\nfrom all genres. (WEBTOON, 2022)\r\nNote that half of these series are tagged under the Romance genre,\r\nwith two of the series not directly tagged as Romance still containing\r\ncentral romance themes (The Unmarried Empress and Suitor\r\nArmor).\r\nThis trend, that Romance Originals are among the most successful\r\nOriginals, will later be corroborated through analysis.\r\nTo conclude this project, we generate a list of 10 Originals that\r\nperform well among both metrics of subscribers and series ratings. We\r\nthen compare this list to WEBTOON‚Äôs official rankings.\r\nWEBTOON Genres\r\nFigure 1 displays which genres contain more Originals.\r\nFigure 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Kaggle, 2022)\r\nNote that some genres contain notably more Originals than others\r\n(Fantasy and Romance) and that the genre distribution does not\r\ncompletely parallel the distribution of average ratings (Figure 2) nor\r\nsubscribers (Figure 3) across genres.\r\nFrom this observation, we can conclude that genre does indeed have\r\nsome effect on a series‚Äô success.\r\n1. Genres and Success\r\nWe can further measure a series‚Äô success with series ratings.\r\nSeries ratings are optional and entirely reader-contributed. Some\r\nfactors readers may consider when voting on series ratings are:\r\nArt quality\r\nWriting quality (i.e.¬†plot, characters)\r\nReader‚Äôs enjoyment\r\nThese factors are shown at play in Figure 2, below.\r\nFigure 2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that the y-axis scale of the graph starts at 8.8 to emphasize\r\nthe rating differences. The standard deviation (Œ¥) is relatively low, so\r\nmost of the series ratings are quite close to the mean rating (Œº) for\r\nall genres. Adding a jump to the scale makes it easier to see the minute\r\ndifference in ratings.\r\nContinuing the analysis, success can also be measured by the number\r\nof subscribers (Figure 3).\r\nFigure 3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRomance wins by a landslide! How very romantic of you, WEBTOON\r\nreaders. Fantasy comes second for number of subscribers, with Action and\r\nDrama at a close third and fourth.\r\nHeartwarming ranks last in subscriber-based popularity. Despite\r\nreceiving the highest ratings, this conclusion is reasonable, seeing as\r\nthere are only 2 Originals in the Heartwarming genre. (WEBTOON authors,\r\ndo you see this unfulfilled market niche? üëÄ)\r\n2. Subscribers vs.¬†Ratings\r\nTo determine if subscribers (largely representing popularity) and\r\nratings (largely representing quality) are related, we compare\r\nsubscribers and ratings.\r\nThe following figures are interactive; hover over any point to\r\nsee the series‚Äô details.\r\nFigure\r\n4: Relationship between Subscribers and Ratings of WEBTOON\r\nOriginals\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Kaggle, 2022)\r\nThe overall correlation between subscribers and ratings is high;\r\nseries with higher subscriber counts also tend to have higher ratings,\r\nand vice versa. This proves that popularity (measured by subscribers)\r\nand quality (measured by ratings) are related.\r\nFigure\r\n5: Relationship between Subscribers and Ratings of WEBTOON Originals by\r\nGenre\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Kaggle, 2022)\r\nThe observations regarding the subscribers-rating relationship across\r\nall genres still holds for most individual genres. SPORTS and\r\nINFORMATIONAL, however, both appear to have a weak correlation between\r\nsubscribers and ratings.\r\n3. Conclusion\r\nThrough this analysis, we conclude that popularity, quality, and\r\ngenre all provide insight into the success of a WEBTOON Original.\r\nTable 2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Kaggle, 2022)\r\nNote: Toggle with the Subscribers and Rating column filters to\r\nsee how the chart changes when popularity or quality are the primary\r\nfactor for success.\r\nThe predicted Top 10 chart From the predicted Top 10 chart,\r\nViewer ratings and subscriber counts prove that Romance and Fantasy\r\nOriginals are the most popular.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\nIt‚Äôd be criminal of me to create a WEBTOON-themed project and not\r\nprovide recommendations, eh? Take a gander at some of my favorites\r\nbelow, in alphabetic order!\r\nYou can find the synopses online, so I‚Äôll just be providing my two\r\ncents. üòâ\r\nOriginal Recommendations\r\nBig Jo, Jungle Julia\r\nA lovely, light but also poignant read that explores body confidence\r\nand all the chaos of being a teenager exploring romantic connection and\r\nthe world.\r\nThe series is finished and not on Daily Pass, which further cements\r\nits binge-worthy status!\r\n\r\nEleceed, Jeho Son and ZHENA\r\nA light read with humorous moments, mindboggling action scenes, and\r\nadorable relationships (between friends, mentor-peers, and some hints of\r\nromantic ones). Electric (haha, that‚Äôs an Eleceed reference) atmospheric\r\nart to pair!\r\n(Also: the author draws cats in the absolute best way!)\r\n\r\nMoon You, Cho Seok\r\nAbsolutely hilarious read with fantastic art too. It is a Daily Pass\r\nseries now, which means you can only read one episode per day for free.\r\nMoon You is a great read though, and Daily Pass does monetarily\r\nsupport the author!\r\n\r\nMuted, Miranda Mundt\r\nParallel City, Goda\r\nA very well done zombie apocalypse story with both intriguing\r\nplotlines revolving the apocalypse and its characters. Overall extremely\r\nhigh-quality.\r\nBut‚Ä¶ maybe don‚Äôt read this one at night. üò∞\r\n\r\nPurple Hyacinth, Ephemerys and\r\nSophism\r\nEven if murder mystery with unbearable romantic tension isn‚Äôt\r\nexactly your cup of tea, PH‚Äôs undeniable quality may just win you over.\r\nThe delightfully written characters and ingenious plot combined with the\r\ncinematic and deliberately meme-packed art make this one a veritable\r\nWEBTOON Original classic!\r\n\r\nRoom of Swords, Toonimated\r\nOne of my favorite WEBTOONs of all time!\r\nAnd that‚Äôs despite being genuinely confusing to me haha; the plot is\r\nabsolutely wild. Time travel, sci-fi, romance, psychological\r\nmanipulation, colorful action scenes, the unexpected‚Ä¶ Room of Swords has\r\nit all!\r\n\r\nSee You in My 19th Life, Lee\r\nHey,\r\nThe Croaking, echorise\r\nThe first WEBTOON I ever read!\r\n\r\nThe Red King, Heylenne\r\nYour Smile is a Trap, AENGO\r\nCanvas Recommendations\r\nBOMIC: A Bom Comic, c2oh\r\nBUUZA!, Shazleen Khan\r\nCarciphona, Shilin\r\nOne of my favorite authors/artists of all time; Shilin‚Äôs art style\r\nand well-developed characters are incredibly beautiful and\r\nendearing.\r\nI‚Äôll also recommend Shilin‚Äôs Amongst Us (no, it‚Äôs not\r\nrelated to the game Among Us), the modern spin-off of Carciphona!\r\n\r\nImmortal Affairs, Blue.Owl\r\nA really interesting take on immortal beings, with characters that\r\nfeel like real people and incredible character-driven storylines.\r\nSome really great life lessons packed into the chapters too!\r\n\r\nRevelation of Eros, AkumaYoru\r\nA very heartbreaking story, based on the true story of the author in\r\nthe author-artist duo behind this WEBTOON.\r\nThere‚Äôs comedy, friendship, and romance served alongside the\r\ncharacters‚Äô growth. Always hits me right in the feels.\r\n\r\nThis Isekai Maid is Forming a Union!, Frostlight\r\nComics\r\nThe nuanced looks at problematic media and multidimensional\r\ncharacters blow my mind each chapter!\r\nThe story is woven in a way that leads readers to decide for\r\nthemselves what is wrong or right, and features satisfyingly competent\r\ncharacters, both in the protagonist and villain rosters.\r\n\r\n",
