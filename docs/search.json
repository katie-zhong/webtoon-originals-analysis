      "contents": "\r\n0. Introduction\r\nVisual storytelling has been around for ages‚Äîever since humans\r\nsmeared berry juice on cave walls with sticks.\r\nIn the modern age, WEBTOON provides a platform for anyone anywhere to\r\nupload their own visual stories for readers around the world to read for\r\nfree.\r\nWEBTOON is a veritable treasure trove of stories, perfect for a bad\r\nday pick-me-up or to inspire you to take charge as the main character of\r\nyour own story. And though each is valuable in its own way, some stories\r\nstill do better than others. Why?\r\nMetrics of Success\r\nCut-and-dry figures are not necessarily the sole indicator of a\r\n‚Äúgood‚Äù WEBTOON, but data analysis can identify patterns in Originals\r\nthat statistically perform well among readers.\r\nThe most blatant common denominator that may reveal patterns is a\r\nseries‚Äô genre. Do certain genres perform better than others? Which\r\ngenres are more popular among readers?\r\nTo measure how genre and overall success of a series are related, we\r\ncompare the independent variable of genre with the dependent variables\r\nof the number of subscribers (in millions) and\r\naverage series rating (rated from 0-10 by readers)\r\nwithin a sample\r\nset of 774 WEBTOON Originals.\r\nTop WEBTOON\r\nOriginals\r\nOriginals are WEBTOON-sponsored stories. Original series are provided\r\ncompensation, editors, and marketing support, among other benefits.\r\nWEBTOON compiles their own list of ‚ÄúTop‚Äù (most popular) Originals,\r\nwhich almost certainly considers many more factors than the two analyzed\r\nin this project.\r\nThe following data is pulled from WEBTOON‚Äôs list of most popular\r\nOriginals across all 16 genres, as of June 30th, 2022, are:\r\nFigure 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTop Originals\r\nfrom all genres. (WEBTOON, 2022)\r\nNote that half of these series are tagged under the Romance genre,\r\nwith two of the series not directly tagged as Romance still containing\r\ncentral romance themes (The Unmarried Empress and Suitor\r\nArmor).\r\nThis trend, that Romance Originals are among the most successful\r\nOriginals, will later be corroborated through analysis.\r\nTo conclude this project, we generate a list of 10 Originals that\r\nperform well among both metrics of subscribers and series ratings. We\r\nthen compare this list to WEBTOON‚Äôs official rankings.\r\n1. Genres, Subscribers, and\r\nRatings\r\nWEBTOON Genres\r\nFigure 2 displays which genres contain more Originals.\r\nFigure 2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Kaggle, 2022)\r\nNote that some genres contain notably more Originals than others\r\n(Fantasy and Romance) and that the genre distribution does not\r\ncompletely parallel the distribution of average subscribers (Figure 3)\r\nnor ratings (Figure 4) across genres.\r\nFrom this observation, we determine that genre does indeed have some\r\neffect on a series‚Äô success.\r\nNumber of Subscribers\r\nSubscribers are a strong indicator of a series‚Äô popularity. We see\r\nwhich genres are most popular in Figure 3, below.\r\nFigure 3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRomance wins by a landslide! How very romantic of you, WEBTOON\r\nreaders. Note that although the number of Fantasy Originals (138) and\r\nRomance Originals (131) is extremely close, that Fantasy significantly\r\nfalls behind in number of subscribers.\r\nAdditionally, Action and Drama, despite falling in the middle of the\r\nratings distribution by genre (Figure 3), rank a close third and fourth\r\nin subscriber counts.\r\nAlso note that for the number of subscribers in millions for all\r\nseries, regardless of genre, the mean Œº is 0.46, and the standard\r\ndeviation Œ¥ is 0.67 (computations below).\r\n\r\n\r\ncda <- read_rds(\"cleaned_data_all.rds\")\r\n\r\nround(mean(cda$subscribers), 2)\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] 0.46\r\n\r\nround(sd(cda$subscribers), 2)\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] 0.67\r\n\r\nSeries Rating\r\nSeries ratings provide a statistic indicator of series quality, as\r\nwell as popularity.\r\nSeries ratings are optional and entirely reader-contributed. Some\r\nfactors readers may consider when voting on series ratings are:\r\nArt quality\r\nWriting quality (i.e.¬†plot, characters)\r\nReader‚Äôs enjoyment\r\nFigure 4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite receiving the highest ratings, Heartwarming ranks last in\r\nsubscriber-based popularity (Figure 3). This conclusion is reasonable,\r\nhowever, seeing as there are only 2 Originals in the entire genre.\r\n(WEBTOON authors, do you see this unfulfilled market niche? üëÄ)\r\nNote that the y-axis scale of the graph starts at 8.8 to emphasize\r\nthe rating differences. The standard deviation (Œ¥) is relatively low, so\r\nmost of the series ratings are quite close to the mean rating (Œº) for\r\nall genres. Adding a jump to the scale makes it easier to see the minute\r\ndifference in ratings.\r\nAlso note that for the ratings for all series, regardless of genre,\r\nthe mean Œº is 9.39, and the standard deviation Œ¥ is 0.57 (computations\r\nbelow).\r\n\r\n\r\nworking_data <- read_rds(\"webtoon-data.rds\")\r\nround(mean(working_data$rating), 2)\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] 9.39\r\n\r\nround(sd(working_data$rating), 2)\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] 0.57\r\n\r\n2. Subscribers vs.¬†Ratings\r\nSome of the previous observations have been surprising: Action and\r\nDrama, despite unexceptional ratings, rack up significant subscriber\r\ncounts. Heartwarming has a low number of subscribers, despite high\r\nratings. These observations lead us to investigate the relationship\r\nbetween subscribers and ratings.\r\nConsider also that a series‚Äô higher subscriber count indicates a\r\nlarger audience. With this increased visibility, more people contribute\r\nto the series‚Äô rating. As such, it is reasonable to predict that the\r\nnumber of subscribers and ratings are related.\r\nWe investigate this relationship in Figure 5.\r\nThe following figures are interactive; hover over any point to\r\nsee the series‚Äô details.\r\nFigure 5:\r\nRelationship between Subscribers and Ratings\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Kaggle, 2022)\r\nThe overall correlation between subscribers and ratings is somewhat\r\nstrong and positive. We conclude that series with higher subscriber\r\ncounts tend to have higher ratings, and low subscriber counts tend to\r\nindicate low ratings.\r\nWe can also explore this relationship by genre (Figure 6).\r\nFigure\r\n6: Relationship between Subscribers and Ratings of WEBTOON Originals by\r\nGenre\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Kaggle, 2022)\r\nThe observations regarding the subscribers-rating relationship across\r\nall genres still holds for most individual genres. Sports and\r\nInformative, however, both appear to have a weak correlation between\r\nsubscribers and ratings.\r\nNote that the red trendline for Superhero does not reflect the\r\ngeneral trend for the genre, as it includes an outlier\r\n(unOrdinary) with a much larger amount of subscribers.\r\n3. Conclusion\r\nTable 1 compiles the Top 10 WEBTOON Originals with the highest\r\nsubscriber counts, while Table 2 compiles the Top 10 WEBTOON Originals\r\nwith the highest ratings.\r\nTable 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Kaggle, 2022)\r\nNote that three of these series are written by Korean creators and\r\ntranslations of the original versions uploaded on Korean WEBTOON\r\nplatform Naver (True Beauty,\r\nTower of God, Sweet Home).\r\nTable 2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Kaggle, 2022)\r\nNote here also that, interestingly, only one of the series\r\n(Purple Hyacinth) is not a translated version of Korean\r\ncreators‚Äô work.\r\nTable 3\r\nFinally, our desired end product, Table 3, compiles the top 10\r\nWEBTOON Originals above the mean subscribers count and the mean series\r\nrating from all the series in Tables 1 and 2, organized in descending\r\norder of number of subscribers (toggle with the Subscribers, Rating,\r\nand Genre column filters to see how the chart changes when different\r\nvariables are set as the primary measure of success).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Kaggle, 2022)\r\nNote that three of these series are written by Korean creators and\r\ntranslations of the original versions (Sweet Home, Tower of God,\r\nTrue Beauty).\r\nThus,\r\nwe conclude that the most likely factors of success for a WEBTOON\r\nOriginal are:\r\nBelonging to the Romance genre\r\nGaining at least 3 million subscribers (at least 2.63 million\r\nsubscribers above the average of 0.46 million)\r\nGarnering at least a 9.5 rating (0.13 above the 9.39 average\r\nrating of all Originals)\r\nAdditional Notes * WEBTOON‚Äôs official Top Originals list is\r\nlikely based on what is trending (i.e.¬†rapidly increasing in number of\r\nsubscribers/ratings at the time of data collection. For reference, see\r\nWEBTOON‚Äôs current Top\r\nOriginals list, and not what series have been the most consistently\r\npopular.\r\nTranslated Korean Naver Originals have accumulated significant\r\nsuccess, despite not originally targeting WEBTOON‚Äôs international,\r\nEnglish-reading audience.\r\nSee the tabs in the blue header above for more details on this\r\nproject!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\nIt‚Äôd be criminal of me to create a WEBTOON-themed project and not\r\nprovide recommendations, eh? Take a gander at some of my favorites\r\nbelow, in alphabetic order!\r\nYou can find the synopses online, so I‚Äôll just be providing my two\r\ncents. üòâ\r\nOriginal Recommendations\r\nBig Jo, Jungle Julia\r\nA lovely, light but also poignant read that explores body confidence\r\nand all the chaos of being a teenager exploring romantic connection and\r\nthe world.\r\nThe series is finished and not on Daily Pass, which further cements\r\nits binge-worthy status!\r\n\r\nEleceed, Jeho Son and ZHENA\r\nA light read with humorous moments, mindboggling action scenes, and\r\nadorable relationships (between friends, mentor-peers, and some hints of\r\nromantic ones). Electric (haha, that‚Äôs an Eleceed reference) atmospheric\r\nart to pair!\r\n(Also: the author draws cats in the absolute best way!)\r\n\r\nMoon You, Cho Seok\r\nAbsolutely hilarious read with fantastic art too. It is a Daily Pass\r\nseries now, which means you can only read one episode per day for free.\r\nMoon You is a great read though, and Daily Pass does monetarily\r\nsupport the author!\r\n\r\nMuted, Miranda Mundt\r\nParallel City, Goda\r\nA very well done zombie apocalypse story with both intriguing\r\nplotlines revolving the apocalypse and its characters. Overall extremely\r\nhigh-quality.\r\nBut‚Ä¶ maybe don‚Äôt read this one at night. üò∞\r\n\r\nPurple Hyacinth, Ephemerys and\r\nSophism\r\nEven if murder mystery with unbearable romantic tension isn‚Äôt\r\nexactly your cup of tea, PH‚Äôs undeniable quality may just win you over.\r\nThe delightfully written characters and ingenious plot combined with the\r\ncinematic and deliberately meme-packed art make this one a veritable\r\nWEBTOON Original classic!\r\n\r\nRoom of Swords, Toonimated\r\nOne of my favorite WEBTOONs of all time!\r\nAnd that‚Äôs despite being genuinely confusing to me haha; the plot is\r\nabsolutely wild. Time travel, sci-fi, romance, psychological\r\nmanipulation, colorful action scenes, the unexpected‚Ä¶ Room of Swords has\r\nit all!\r\n\r\nSee You in My 19th Life, Lee\r\nHey,\r\nThe Croaking, echorise\r\nThe first WEBTOON I ever read!\r\n\r\nThe Red King, Heylenne\r\nYour Smile is a Trap, AENGO\r\nCanvas Recommendations\r\nBOMIC: A Bom Comic, c2oh\r\nBUUZA!, Shazleen Khan\r\nCarciphona, Shilin\r\nOne of my favorite authors/artists of all time; Shilin‚Äôs art style\r\nand well-developed characters are incredibly beautiful and\r\nendearing.\r\nI‚Äôll also recommend Shilin‚Äôs Amongst Us (no, it‚Äôs not\r\nrelated to the game Among Us), the modern spin-off of Carciphona!\r\n\r\nImmortal Affairs, Blue.Owl\r\nA really interesting take on immortal beings, with characters that\r\nfeel like real people and incredible character-driven storylines.\r\nSome really great life lessons packed into the chapters too!\r\n\r\nRevelation of Eros, AkumaYoru\r\nA very heartbreaking story, based on the true story of the author in\r\nthe author-artist duo behind this WEBTOON.\r\nThere‚Äôs comedy, friendship, and romance served alongside the\r\ncharacters‚Äô growth. Always hits me right in the feels.\r\n\r\nThis Isekai Maid is Forming a Union!, Frostlight\r\nComics\r\nThe nuanced looks at problematic media and multidimensional\r\ncharacters blow my mind each chapter!\r\nThe story is woven in a way that leads readers to decide for\r\nthemselves what is wrong or right, and features satisfyingly competent\r\ncharacters, both in the protagonist and villain rosters.\r\n\r\n",
