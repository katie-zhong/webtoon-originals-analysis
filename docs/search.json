Thank you to our ‚Äúdear leader‚Äù Preceptor Kane, our superhero\r\nTFs, and the supportive classmates that made this experience so\r\nenjoyable and rewarding! :)\r\nAbout The Creator\r\nHey! It‚Äôs me, that little voice writing out all these words, finally\r\nintroducing myself. My name is Katie Zhong and I‚Äôm an\r\nincoming Honours Mathematics freshman at the University of Waterloo.\r\nI love music, reading, stories, and art (as you may have guessed üòÖ).\r\nGot any recommendations? Feel free to\r\nshare, I‚Äôll give anything a try!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\nMetrics of Success\r\nThough cut-and-dry figures are not necessarily an indicator of a\r\n‚Äúgood‚Äù WEBTOON, data analysis can identify patterns in Originals that\r\nstatistically perform well among readers.\r\nThe follow metrics of success are compared to variables such as genre\r\nthroughout this project:\r\nNumber of subscribers\r\nRating\r\nGenres and Popularity\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAverage series ratings are about the same for Originals across all\r\ngenres, with Originals from the Heartwarming genre receiving the highest\r\nand Originals from the Superhero genre receiving the lowest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRomance wins by a landslide! How very romantic of you, WEBTOON\r\nreaders. Fantasy comes second for number of subscribers, with Action and\r\nDrama at a close third and fourth.\r\nHeartwarming ranking last in subscriber-based popularity, despite\r\nreceiving the highest ratings, makes sense as there are only 2 Originals\r\nin the Heartwarming genre. (WEBTOON authors, do you see this unfulfilled\r\nmarket niche? üëÄ)\r\nSubscribers vs.¬†Ratings\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nViewer ratings and subscriber counts prove that Romance and Fantasy\r\nOriginals are the most popular.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
