      "contents": "\r\n0. Introduction\r\nVisual storytelling has been around for ages‚Äîever since humans\r\nsmeared berry juice on cave walls with sticks for their own\r\nenjoyment.\r\nIn the modern age, WEBTOON provides a platform for anyone anywhere to\r\nupload their own visual stories for readers around the world to read for\r\nfree.\r\nWEBTOON is a veritable treasure trove of stories, perfect for a bad\r\nday pick-me-up or to inspire you to take charge of your own story. And\r\nthough each is valuable in its own way, some stories still do better\r\nthan others. Why?\r\nMetrics of Success\r\nCut-and-dry figures are not necessarily the sole indicator of a\r\n‚Äúgood‚Äù WEBTOON, but data analysis can identify patterns in Originals\r\nthat statistically perform well among readers.\r\nWhat defines success? Popularity? Quality? Both? And could these\r\nfactors be related?\r\nTo measure both popularity and quality, the following metrics of\r\nsuccess are compared to variables such as genre:\r\nNumber of subscribers (in millions)\r\nMeasures popularity\r\nAlso provides some minor indication of quality (as a general\r\nrule, people are more likely to be drawn to content within a certain\r\nquality threshold)\r\nAverage series rating (rated from 0-10 by\r\nreaders)\r\nMeasures quality (see Genres and Success)\r\nAlso provides some minor indication of popularity (readers are\r\nlikely to rate their favorite series higher, in which case emotional\r\nconnection can prevail over perceived quality)\r\nWEBTOON Top\r\nOriginals\r\nWEBTOON compiles their own list of ‚ÄúTop‚Äù (most popular) Originals,\r\nwhich almost certainly considers many more factors than the two analyzed\r\nin this project. As ranked by WEBTOON, the most popular Originals across\r\nall genres are:\r\nFigure 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTop Originals\r\nfrom all genres. (WEBTOON, 2022)\r\nHalf of the Top 10 Originals are directly tagged under the Romance\r\ngenre. As shown in the synopses, The Remarried Empress and\r\nSuitor Armor are also romance-heavy stories.\r\nTo conclude this project, we generate a list of 10 Originals that\r\nperform well among both metrics of subscribers and series ratings. We\r\nthen compare this list to WEBTOON‚Äôs official rankings.\r\nWEBTOON Genres\r\nA series‚Äô genre can also affect its success. Table 1 displays which\r\ngenres contain more Originals.\r\nTable 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Kaggle, 2022)\r\nNote that some genres contain notably more Originals than others and\r\nthat the genre distribution does not directly parallel the distribution\r\nof average ratings (Figure 2) nor subscribers (Figure 3) across\r\ngenres.\r\nThis is because the relationship between demand and supply is not\r\nlinear (many authors may prioritize personal fulfillment over creating a\r\n‚Äúpopular‚Äù series), though strongly proportional.\r\n1. Genres and Success\r\nQuality and popularity can be measured with series ratings.\r\nAmong others, the following factors are the most common when readers\r\nvote on series ratings:\r\nQuality of the series (ex. art, plot)\r\nReader‚Äôs enjoyment of the series\r\nThese factors are shown at play in Figure 2, below.\r\nFigure 2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that the y-axis scale of the graph starts at 8.5 to emphasize\r\nthe rating differences.\r\nAverage series ratings are about the same for Originals across all\r\ngenres, with Originals from the Heartwarming genre receiving the highest\r\nand Originals from the Superhero genre receiving the lowest.\r\nAlternately, popularity can also be measured by the number of\r\nsubscribers (Figure 3).\r\nFigure 3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRomance wins by a landslide! How very romantic of you, WEBTOON\r\nreaders. Fantasy comes second for number of subscribers, with Action and\r\nDrama at a close third and fourth.\r\nHeartwarming ranking last in subscriber-based popularity, despite\r\nreceiving the highest ratings, makes sense as there are only 2 Originals\r\nin the Heartwarming genre. (WEBTOON authors, do you see this unfulfilled\r\nmarket niche? üëÄ)\r\n2. Subscribers vs.¬†Ratings\r\nTo determine if subscribers (representing popularity) and ratings\r\n(representing quality, with a lesser indication of popularity) are\r\nrelated, we compare subscribers and ratings.\r\nFigure\r\n4: Relationship between Subscribers and Ratings of WEBTOON\r\nOriginals\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Kaggle, 2022)\r\nFigure\r\n5: Relationship between Subscribers and Ratings of WEBTOON Originals by\r\nGenre\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Kaggle, 2022)\r\n3. Conclusion\r\nViewer ratings and subscriber counts prove that Romance and Fantasy\r\nOriginals are the most popular.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\nIt‚Äôd be criminal of me to create a WEBTOON-themed project and not\r\nprovide recommendations, eh? Take a gander at some of my favorites\r\nbelow, in alphabetic order!\r\nYou can find the synopses online, so I‚Äôll just be providing my two\r\ncents. üòâ\r\nOriginal Recommendations\r\nBig Jo, Jungle Julia\r\nA lovely, light but also poignant read that explores body confidence\r\nand all the chaos of being a teenager exploring romantic connection and\r\nthe world.\r\nThe series is finished and not on Daily Pass, which further cements\r\nits binge-worthy status!\r\n\r\nEleceed, Jeho Son and ZHENA\r\nA light read with humorous moments, mindboggling action scenes, and\r\nadorable relationships (between friends, mentor-peers, and some hints of\r\nromantic ones). Electric (haha, that‚Äôs an Eleceed reference) atmospheric\r\nart to pair!\r\n(Also: the author draws cats in the absolute best way!)\r\n\r\nMoon You, Cho Seok\r\nAbsolutely hilarious read with fantastic art too. It is a Daily Pass\r\nseries now, which means you can only read one episode per day for free.\r\nMoon You is a great read though, and Daily Pass does monetarily\r\nsupport the author!\r\n\r\nMuted, Miranda Mundt\r\nParallel City, Goda\r\nA very well done zombie apocalypse story with both intriguing\r\nplotlines revolving the apocalypse and its characters. Overall extremely\r\nhigh-quality.\r\nBut‚Ä¶ maybe don‚Äôt read this one at night. üò∞\r\n\r\nPurple Hyacinth, Ephemerys and\r\nSophism\r\nEven if murder mystery with unbearable romantic tension isn‚Äôt\r\nexactly your cup of tea, PH‚Äôs undeniable quality may just win you over.\r\nThe delightfully written characters and ingenious plot combined with the\r\ncinematic and deliberately meme-packed art make this one a veritable\r\nWEBTOON Original classic!\r\n\r\nRoom of Swords, Toonimated\r\nOne of my favorite WEBTOONs of all time!\r\nAnd that‚Äôs despite being genuinely confusing to me haha; the plot is\r\nabsolutely wild. Time travel, sci-fi, romance, psychological\r\nmanipulation, colorful action scenes, the unexpected‚Ä¶ Room of Swords has\r\nit all!\r\n\r\nSee You in My 19th Life, Lee\r\nHey,\r\nThe Croaking, echorise\r\nThe first WEBTOON I ever read!\r\n\r\nThe Red King, Heylenne\r\nYour Smile is a Trap, AENGO\r\nCanvas Recommendations\r\nBOMIC: A Bom Comic, c2oh\r\nBUUZA!, Shazleen Khan\r\nCarciphona, Shilin\r\nOne of my favorite authors/artists of all time; Shilin‚Äôs art style\r\nand well-developed characters are incredibly beautiful and\r\nendearing.\r\nI‚Äôll also recommend Shilin‚Äôs Amongst Us (no, it‚Äôs not\r\nrelated to the game Among Us), the modern spin-off of Carciphona!\r\n\r\nImmortal Affairs, Blue.Owl\r\nA really interesting take on immortal beings, with characters that\r\nfeel like real people and incredible character-driven storylines.\r\nSome really great life lessons packed into the chapters too!\r\n\r\nRevelation of Eros, AkumaYoru\r\nA very heartbreaking story, based on the true story of the author in\r\nthe author-artist duo behind this WEBTOON.\r\nThere‚Äôs comedy, friendship, and romance served alongside the\r\ncharacters‚Äô growth. Always hits me right in the feels.\r\n\r\nThis Isekai Maid is Forming a Union!, Frostlight\r\nComics\r\nThe nuanced looks at problematic media and multidimensional\r\ncharacters blow my mind each chapter!\r\nThe story is woven in a way that leads readers to decide for\r\nthemselves what is wrong or right, and features satisfyingly competent\r\ncharacters, both in the protagonist and villain rosters.\r\n\r\n",
