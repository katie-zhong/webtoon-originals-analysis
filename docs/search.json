      "contents": "\r\nMetrics of Success\r\nThough cut-and-dry figures are not necessarily an indicator of a\r\n“good” WEBTOON, data analysis can identify patterns in Originals that\r\nstatistically perform well among readers.\r\nThe follow metrics of success are compared to variables such as genre\r\nthroughout this project:\r\nNumber of subscribers\r\nRating\r\nGenres and Popularity\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAverage series ratings are about the same for Originals across all\r\ngenres, with Originals from the Heartwarming genre receiving the highest\r\nand Originals from the Superhero genre receiving the lowest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRomance wins by a landslide! How very romantic of you, WEBTOON\r\nreaders. Fantasy comes second for number of subscribers, with Action and\r\nDrama at a close third and fourth.\r\nSurprisingly, Heartwarming ranks last in subscriber-based popularity,\r\ndespite receiving the highest ratings.\r\nSubscribers vs. Ratings\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that newly-launched Originals (those with three or more\r\nepisodes) were included within the data used for these graphs, as\r\nsuccess can still be measured with the same variables that apply to\r\nolder Originals. Though newer Originals are more heavily promoted, older\r\nOriginals also received the same treatment when they were launched.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
