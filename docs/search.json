Thank you to our ‚Äúdear leader‚Äù Preceptor Kane, our superhero\r\nTFs, and the supportive classmates that made this experience so\r\nenjoyable and rewarding! :)\r\nAbout The Creator\r\nHey! It‚Äôs me, that little voice writing out all these words, finally\r\nintroducing myself. My name is Katie Zhong and I‚Äôm an\r\nincoming Honours Mathematics freshman at the University of Waterloo.\r\nI love music, reading, stories, and art (as you may have guessed üòÖ).\r\nGot any recommendations? Feel free to\r\nshare, I‚Äôll give anything a try!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\nMetrics of Success\r\nThough cut-and-dry figures are not necessarily an indicator of a\r\n‚Äúgood‚Äù WEBTOON, data analysis can identify patterns in Originals that\r\nstatistically perform well among readers.\r\nThe follow metrics of success are compared to variables such as genre\r\nthroughout this project:\r\nNumber of subscribers\r\nRating\r\nGenres and Popularity\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAverage series ratings are about the same for Originals across all\r\ngenres, with Originals from the Heartwarming genre receiving the highest\r\nand Originals from the Superhero genre receiving the lowest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRomance wins by a landslide! How very romantic of you, WEBTOON\r\nreaders. Fantasy comes second for number of subscribers, with Action and\r\nDrama at a close third and fourth.\r\nHeartwarming ranking last in subscriber-based popularity, despite\r\nreceiving the highest ratings, makes sense as there are only 2 Originals\r\nin the Heartwarming genre. (WEBTOON authors, do you see this unfulfilled\r\nmarket niche? üëÄ)\r\nSubscribers vs.¬†Ratings\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nViewer ratings and subscriber counts prove that Romance and Fantasy\r\nOriginals are the most popular.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Take a gander at some of my favorites\r\nbelow, in alphabetic order!\r\nYou can find the synopses online, so I‚Äôll just be providing my two\r\ncents. üòâ\r\nOriginal Recommendations\r\nBig Jo, Jungle Julia\r\n\r\nThe series is finished and not on Daily Pass, which further cements\r\nits binge-worthy status!\r\n\r\nEleceed, Jeho Son and ZHENA\r\nA light read with humorous moments, mindboggling action scenes, and\r\nadorable character relationships. Lovely, atmospheric art to pair.\r\n(Also: the author draws cats in the absolute best way!)\r\n\r\nMoon You, Cho Seok\r\nAbsolutely hilarious read with fantastic art too. It is a Daily Pass\r\nseries now, which means you can only read one episode per day for free.\r\nMoon You is a great read though, and Daily Pass does monetarily\r\nsupport the author!\r\n\r\nMuted, \r\n\r\n\r\nParallel City, Goda\r\nPurple Hyacinth, Ephemerys and\r\nSophism\r\nEven if murder mystery with unbearable romantic tension isn‚Äôt\r\nexactly your cup of tea, PH‚Äôs undeniable quality may just win you over.\r\nThe delightfully written characters and ingenious plot combined with the\r\ncinematic and deliberately meme-packed art make this one a veritable\r\nWEBTOON Original classic.\r\n\r\nRoom of Swords, Toonimated\r\nSee You in My 19th Life, Lee\r\nHey,\r\nThe Croaking echorise\r\nThe Red King, Heylenne\r\nYour Smile is a Trap, AENGO\r\nCanvas Recommendations\r\nBOMIC: A Bom Comic, c2oh\r\nBUUZA!, Shazleen Khan\r\nCarciphona, Shilin\r\nOne of my favorite authors/artists of all time; Shilin‚Äôs art style\r\nand well-developed characters are incredibly beautiful and\r\nendearing.\r\nI‚Äôll also recommend Shilin‚Äôs Amongst Us (no, it‚Äôs not\r\nrelated to the game Among Us), the modern spin-off of Carciphona!\r\n\r\nImmortal Affairs, Blue.Owl\r\nRevelation of Eros, AkumaYoru\r\nThis Isekai Maid is Forming a Union!, Frostlight\r\nComics\r\nThe nuanced looks at problematic media and multidimensional\r\ncharacters blow my mind each chapter.\r\n\r\n",
