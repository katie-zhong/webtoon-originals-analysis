## Metrics of Success
Though cut-and-dry figures are not the sole indicator (or, objectively, a good indicator at all) of a "successful" or "good" WEBTOON, data analysis can identify patterns in Originals that statistically perform well among readers.

The follow metrics of success are compared to variables such as genre throughout this project:
* Number of subscribers
* Rating


## Data
#Genres and Popularity
```{r}
include_graphics("genre_ratings.png")
include_graphics("genre_subscribers.png")
```

#Subscribers vs. Ratings
```{r}
#include_graphics("subscribers_ratings_all.png")
#include_graphics("subscribers_ratings_genre.png")
```

Note that newly-launched Originals (those with three or more episodes) were included within the data used for these graphs, as success can still be measured with the same variables that apply to older Originals. Though newer Originals are more heavily promoted, older Originals also received the same treatment when they were launched.
