## **Metrics of Success**
Though cut-and-dry figures are not necessarily an indicator of a "good" WEBTOON, data analysis can identify patterns in Originals that statistically perform well among readers.

The follow metrics of success are compared to variables such as genre throughout this project:

* Number of subscribers
* Rating




## Genres and Popularity
```{r genre_ratings_plot}
include_graphics("genre_ratings.png")
```


Average series ratings are about the same for Originals across all genres, with Originals from the Heartwarming genre receiving the highest and Originals from the Superhero genre receiving the lowest.


```{r genre_subscribers_plot}
include_graphics("genre_subscribers.png")
```


Romance wins by a landslide! How very romantic of you, WEBTOON readers. Fantasy comes second for number of subscribers, with Action and Drama at a close third and fourth.

Heartwarming ranking last in subscriber-based popularity, despite receiving the highest ratings, makes sense as there are only 2 Originals in the Heartwarming genre. (WEBTOON authors, do you see this unfulfilled market niche? ðŸ‘€)


## Subscribers vs. Ratings
```{r subscribers_ratings_all_plot}
read_rds(file = "subscribers_ratings_all.rds")
```

```{r subscribers_ratings_genre_plot}
read_rds(file = "subscribers_ratings_genre.rds")
```



## **Conclusion**
Viewer ratings and subscriber counts prove that Romance and Fantasy Originals are the most popular.
