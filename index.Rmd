## Metrics of Success
Though cut-and-dry figures are not the sole indicator (or, objectively, a good indicator at all) of a "successful" or "good" WEBTOON, data analysis can identify patterns in Originals that statistically perform well among readers.

The follow metrics of success are compared to variables such as genre throughout this project:
* Number of subscribers
* Rating
